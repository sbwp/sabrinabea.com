# Advanced JavaScript
Whereas [So You Think You Know JavaScript](../sytykjs/index) presented a guided journey from beginner to advanced-level JavaScript, this serves more as a loose collection of unrelated topics within JavaScript that are all at the advanced level. These are features of the language that you could easily go your entire JavaScript-developing career without ever understanding, but are useful to understand in case you do run into them or a situation where they would be a good solution. Feel free to jump around between topics you find interesting, or to read through from start to finish if you prefer.
