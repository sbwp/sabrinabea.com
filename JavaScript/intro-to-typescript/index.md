# Introduction to TypeScript
This will be an introduction to TypeScript, starting from the most basic syntax and leading up to advanced features of the type system. Note that in JavaScript examples, we will use `require` for imports. Even though the ESM `import` is becoming increasingly common in JavaScript projects, it is still very likely that many people will first encounter `import` or first switch fully to it when learning TypeScript, so I've treated this like a language difference even though it technically isn't.
