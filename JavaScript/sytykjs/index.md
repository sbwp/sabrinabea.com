# So You Think You Know JavaScript?
At the surface, JavaScript can seem like a quite simple language. It has functions, arrays, objects, strings, for loops, and many other mainstays of programming languages, but lacks type safety. Perhaps you've written a bit of JavaScript yourself and found it to be very similar to other languages with C-style syntax, but without many of the higher-concept Object-Oriented features.

On the other hand, you may have heard it said that JavaScript is a strange and powerful language. Perhaps you've wondered what they meant, or maybe you assumed it was all because of the lack of type restrictions. This article aims to answer the question: What's so special about JavaScript?
