## Next Steps
With that, we've covered the basics of TypeScript, as well as a few of the cooler and more useful features.

The [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) is a great resource for learning more about the language and a great reference while working on TypeScript code. If you're working on some code and start to wonder how some langauge feature works, try it out in the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) and see how it works.

If you haven't checked them out already, I have courses on the basics of [RxJS](../RxJS/0-intro) and intermediate [JavaScript](../So%20You%20Think%20You%20Know%20JavaScript/0-intro) that will be very useful for any TypeScript developer.

By far the most useful thing you can do to further your knowledge and skills of TypeScript is to use it and to try to get the most out of it. You'll have plenty of opportunities to learn more about TypeScript and put its type system to the fullest use if you never use `@ts-ignore` and try your best to avoid using the type `any` wherever possible. Try to make the language work for you and strongly type whatever you can to maximize the information you are getting out of the type system. Doing this will lead you down many rabbit holes where you can learn all about the intricacies of the type system.
