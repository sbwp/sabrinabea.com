# JavaScript
This folder contains a number of "courses" on JavaScript. If you knew nothing about programming or JavaScript and wanted to read all of these, the order to do so would be:
1. [Intro to Programming, with JavaScript](Intro%20to%20Programming,%20with%20JavaScript/0-intro.md) [WIP]  
    This course covers the basics of programming, and it uses JavaScript to do so. This course assumes no knowledge of programming, so if you read it and have any questions, let me know so I can clarify or expound, as no outside knowledge is supposed to be assumed, aside from reading English and middle-school-level math. Each chapter does build on the previous ones, however.
1. [Intro to JavaScript](Intro%20to%20JavaScript/0-intro.md) [WIP]  
    This course assumes basic knowledge of programming in some C-like language, but no knowledge of JavaScript.
1. [So You Think You Know JavaScript?](So%20You%20Think%20You%20Know%20JavaScript/0-intro.md)  
    This course assumes you are familiar with JavaScript enough to write basic programs in it, and you may derive more value from some chapters if you are familiar with object-oriented programming and some C-like language, but that knowledge should not be required to read this.
1. [Intro to TypeScript](Intro%20to%20TypeScript/0-intro.md)  [WIP]  
    This course assumes knowledge of JavaScript features and introduces programming in TypeScript. Knowledge of JavaScript is assumed, although more advanced concepts will either be explained or have a link to the relevant chapter in another course.
1. [RxJS](RxJS/0-intro.md)  [WIP]  
    This is a course entirely dedicated to the library RxJS, which enables reactive programming in JavaScript. Knowledge of asynchronous JavaScript, including callbacks, Promises, and async/await, is assumed. This course uses TypeScript, although you should be able to ignore the additional syntax of TypeScript if you are not familiar with it.
